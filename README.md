# Python-assignment
Task:

Transform the data present in ‘Sample Input’ CSV into ‘Sample Output’ CSV using
Python.

Details:

1. See comments in ‘Sample Input’ for column mapping (e.g., ItemId becomes
tag__id)

2. ‘Sample Input’ has all tags captured in one row. Whereas in ‘Sample Output’ we
need one tag per row. That’s why it is called a transformation task.

3. ‘Sample Input’ has data captured every 5 milliseconds. We need to aggregate it
to 10 sec using MAX as the aggregation function.

Output: The output for the following code is given output_csv.csv file.
